1. On the artist's dashboard, it should should show all the artworks that belong to that artist.
2. The main Home page should show a few artworks (hard-coded) and should then have a link to "All Artworks" which should display all the artworks of all the artists
The class name for all the forms that should be at the centre of the page should be "page form". They could then each have their own respective ids.
The admin should be able to delete users.
In your model/schema one more user type should be Admin.

For Admins:
        - You could have an admin register and login page. Once the Admin Registers they would be added to the users table.
        -You could create a passcode table/schema. First the admin types in the code and if present in the table, they are redirected to the admin-login page. OR BETTER YET when registering, there is a new field for the passcode. if it matches any of the passcodes in the table, then it the user is added as an admin.
        -You DONT need to have more than one table. only one table would be needed, it's just that the user-type would be admin. 
Could create an update profile section/link/endpoint to allow users who signed up with google, update their work (But do that later)
